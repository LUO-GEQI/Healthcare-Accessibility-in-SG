        <h1>Healthcare Accessibility in Singaporeüöë</h1>

        <p><b><i>Access to healthcare</b></i> is essential for a thriving society, yet some neighborhoods in Singapore face challenges in reaching hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Our data visualization project aims to highlight these gaps by analyzing the 15-minute walking accessibility of healthcare facilities across the country. Through interactive maps, we illustrate which areas enjoy adequate medical services and which communities may struggle to access essential care. 
            <br><br> 
            The <b><i>storymap</i></b> used government open data, mapping the distribution of healthcare facilities and calculate their walkshed coverage based on pedestrian-friendly routes. This allows us to identify healthcare deserts, where residents may have difficulty obtaining timely medical attention. By overlaying demographic data, we can further explore how healthcare accessibility varies among different socioeconomic groups, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the attention they need.
            <br><br>
            Through the <b><i>crowdsourced map</i></b>via the Ushahidi platform, users can report real-life healthcare access challenges, such as long waiting times, limited transport options, or understaffed clinics. This participatory approach empowers communities to contribute firsthand insights, fostering a more responsive and equitable healthcare system. Together, we can build a Healthier SG by ensuring that no one is left behind in accessing essential medical care. üöëüìç
